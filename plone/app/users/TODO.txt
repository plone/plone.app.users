Z3C Forms TODOs
---------------

[ ] Add unit-tests to collective.examples.userdata
[ ] when this PLIP merged into master, then we need to update
    Products.CMFPlone csrf.txt doc test to work for z3c.form version of
    'register' form; one small change required: change button name from
    form.actions.register to form.buttons.register; actually we'll make it
    work for both versions
